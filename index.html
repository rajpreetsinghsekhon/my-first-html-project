        <p><b>The History of Punjab refers to the past history of Punjab region
 which is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in the northwest of South 
 Asia, comprising eastern Punjab province in Pakistan and western Punjab state in
  India.[1] It is believed that the earliest evidence of human habitation in Punjab t
  races to the Soan valley of the Pothohar, between the Indus and the Jhelum rivers, 
  where Soanian culture developed between 774,000 BC and 11,700 BC. This period goes back 
  to the first interglacial period in the second Ice Age, from which remnants of 
  stone and flint tools have been found.[2]

 The Punjab region was the site of one of the earliest cradle of civilizations, 
 the Bronze Age Harrapan civilization that flourished from about 3000 B.C. and 
 declined rapidly 1,000 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations that 
 overran the region in waves between 1500 and 500 B.C.[3] The migrating Indo-Aryan 
 tribes gave rise to the Iron Age Vedic civilization, which lasted till 500 BC. 
 During this era, the Rigveda was composed in Punjab,[4] laying the foundation 
 of Hinduism. In the 6th century BC, Pushkarasarin, the monarch of Gandhara, assumed a role in halting the expansionary ambitions of the Achaemenid Empire until during the reign of Darius wherein tribute rendered by Gandhara to him is first documented.[5] A century later, the Janapadas of Punjab encountered the expansive undertakings of Alexander. The Janapadas exhibited resistance to his advances, notably the Aśvaka of Gandhara, the Mallians of South Punjab, and Porus of Central Punjab.[6] Following the demise of Alexander, Chandragupta Maurya, who had received his education in the city of Taxila, garnered support from republics such as Trigarta and Gandhara.[7] He subsequently conquered the Nanda Empire, with Taxila being designated as the provincial capital of the Northwestern territories. After its decline, the Indo-Greeks, Indo-Sakas and Indo-Parthians successively established reigns in Punjab however during this time a local kingdom known as the Apracharajas, maintained autonomy and other janapadas such as that of the Yaudheya and the Audumbaras in Eastern Punjab resisted their expansions.[8][9] In the late 1st century AD the Kushan Empire annexed Punjab, Gandharas cultural zenith occurred during this period in which artwork from the region flourished.
    <br>
 The devastating Hunnic invasions of Punjab occurred in the 5th and 6th century, which were ultimately repelled by the Vardhana dynasty.[10][11] Most of the western Punjab region became unified under the Taank And Odi Shahi Kingdoms in the early medieval period. Between the 8th and 12th century, the Tomara dynasty and Katoch dynasty controlled the eastern portions of Punjab.[12] Islam became established in Punjab when the Umayyad Caliphate conquered southern portions of the region up to Multan, which became independent from the caliphate under the Emirate of Multan in 855. The Ghaznavids conquered region in 1025, after whom the Delhi Sultanate followed. The Langah Sultanate ruled much of the south Punjab in the 15th century.
          
 The Mughal Empire, established in 1526 AD, has left an immense cultural and architectural legacy in Punjab. The city of Lahore became one of the largest in the world under Mughals. In the 16th century, Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak in central Punjab which attracted many followers. After a long period of anarchy due to decline of Mughals in the 18th century, the Sikh Empire in 1799 unified most of the Punjab region. The region was conquered by the British EIC in 1849 after Second Anglo-Sikh War and Punjab province was created in 1857. In 1947, Punjab was partitioned amidst wide-scale violence.
            
 Etymology
         <br>   
 Though the name Punjab is of Persian origin, its two parts (پنج, panj, 'five' and آب, āb, 'water') are cognates of the Sanskrit words, पञ्‍च, pañca, 'five' and अप्, áp, 'water', of the same meaning.[1][13] The word Pañjāb thus means 'The Land of Five Waters', referring to the rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas.[14] All are tributaries of the Indus River, the Sutlej being the largest. References to a land of five rivers may be found in the Mahabharata, which calls one of the regions in Aryavarta Panchanada (Sanskrit: पञ्चनद, romanized: pañca-nada, lit. 'five rivers').[15][16] The ancient Greeks referred to the region as Pentapotamía (Greek: Πενταποταμία),[17][18] which has the same meaning as the Persian word.[19]
            
 Geographical extent
            
 The region of Punjab (lit. The land of five rivers)
 Today Punjab region is usually considered to consist of Punjab province in Pakistan and Punjab state in India. The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term "Punjab" has changed over time. In the 16th century, Mughal Empire referred it to a relatively smaller area between the Indus and the Sutlej rivers.[20] In British Raj, the Punjab Province was a large administrative region encompassing the present-day Indian states and union territories of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Delhi and the Pakistani regions of Punjab and Islamabad Capital Territory. It bordered Balochistan and North-West Frontier to the west, Jammu and Kashmir to the north, the Hindi Belt to the east, and Rajasthan and Sindh to the south.[21]
            
 Prehistory
 Paleolithic
 Main article: Soanian Homo erectus lived on the Pothohar Plateau, in upper Punjab, Pakistan along the Soan River (nearby modern-day Rawalpindi) during the Pleistocene Epoch. Soanian sites are found in the Sivalik region across what are now India, Pakistan and Nepal.[22] The Soanian culture was a prehistoric technological culture from the Siwalik Hills.[23][24] It is named after the Soan Valley in Punjab, Pakistan.[25] The Soanian culture has been approximated to have taken place during the Middle Pleistocene period or the mid-Holocene epoch (Northgrippian). Soanian artifacts were manufactured on quartzite pebbles, cobbles, and occasionally on boulders, all derived from various fluvial sources on the Siwalik landscape. Soanian assemblages generally comprise varieties of choppers, discoids, scrapers, cores, and numerous flake type tools, all occurring in varying typo-technological frequencies at different sites.[26]
            
 Neolithic
  Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BCE in the Pothohar Plateau in north of Punjab that indicate the region was home to Neolithic peoples who settled on the banks of the Swaan River,[27] and who later developed small communities in the region around 3000 BCE.[27]</b></p>
